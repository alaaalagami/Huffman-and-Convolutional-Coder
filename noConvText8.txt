in this ptper, a novel ddeaenomation-based concpenoavoetrital psedisnortion (dpd) soluwastis proposed for dual-band transmitters (tx) employing a aingle wideband power amplifier (pa), and utilizing jusmp wa rle feedback receiver xrh ixhn proposed decorrepation-based parameterhoprnin(solution is both flexible and simplettieed operates in s closed-loop manner, opposed to the srpdmy apqpowaoetooh learning architecture. the proposed decorrelation-based lioteing and dpd processinf can also be effectively applied to more ordinary single-band transmirsions, as well as generalized to more t)sttwo transmit bands. through a comprimeesive analysis covering both the dpd parameter learning and the main path processing, in is shown ttlrtthe complexity of the proposed concupariroide,nfubstantially lower coupared with the otlnr state-of-the-art concurrent dpd methods. extensive set af quantitative simulation and rf measurement results are also presented, using a base-station pa as well as a commerciahit e-adatneced mobile pa, toeevaluate a-ei  nppen e the effectiveness of the proposed dpd solution in varrous real world scenarios, incorporatint fgwioooeieedamoigiosband tx eled bmke simulation and rf measurement results demonstrate excellent linearization performance of the psoposed concurrent dpd, even outper-orming current state-of-the-art tokods, despite the significantly lower complexity.
