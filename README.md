# Huffman-and-Convolutional-Coder
A Matlab implementation of the Huffman encoder and decoder and a channel convolutional encoder and viterbi decoder. The main.m file tests the implementation's performance with different SNR levels and compares it to the performance of a channel without convolutional coding.
